This package provides a JavaScript wrapper for [Subtrace](https://github.com/subtrace/subtrace).

Here's how you can get started with Subtrace in your backend JavaScript app.

1. Install this package using `npm install subtrace` or `yarn add subtrace`.
2. Add `require("subtrace")` as a top level import in your app.
3. Start your app as you normally would.

That's it! You should see a `subt.link` URL printed in your console. Go to this
URL in your browser to see your backend requests show up in real time.

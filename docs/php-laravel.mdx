You can connect your Laravel backend to Chrome DevTools using Subtrace with
just one command. With Subtrace, you can inspect the status, headers, payload,
and latency of all API requests, which makes you way faster at debugging.

Download the latest version of Subtrace using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Then get a `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` from the Subtrace [dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard)
for free and set it as an environment variable.

```bash
# get a tracer token for free at https://subtrace.dev/dashboard
export SUBTRACE_TOKEN=
```

Then start your Laravel server using Subtrace:

```
subtrace run -- php artisan serve
```

Send some requests to your Laravel server to see them automatically appear in
Chrome DevTools in the Subtrace dashboard!

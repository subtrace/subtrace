<Note>
  This guide assumes that your app is deployed on a Linux machine. If your app
  is running on macOS, see [here](/macos).
</Note>

Here's what you'll see when you log in to the Subtrace
[dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard) for the first time:

<img className="rounded-xl" src="/images/onboarding-main.png" />

Choose the backend that you're using and follow the instructions to start your
app with Subtrace.

<img
  className="rounded-xl max-w-1/2"
  style={{ maxWidth: "50%", justifySelf: "center" }}
  src="/images/onboarding-steps.png"
/>

Subtrace automatically detects when you've started your app:

<img
  className="rounded-xl max-w-1/2"
  style={{ maxWidth: "50%", justifySelf: "center" }}
  src="/images/onboarding-done.png"
/>

And that's it! You can hit "Finish", and send some requests to your app to see them
show up in realtime.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My backend isn't listed here, can I still use Subtrace?">
    Absolutely! Subtrace supports every language and framework out of the box.
    You can select "Other" as your tech stack in the setup for generic
    instructions on how to use Subtrace with any backend.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title={`What happens if I choose "I'll do this later"?`}>
    You can still set up your app with Subtrace. Check our guides for your
    specific backend.

    If you'd like to see the setup instructions again, simply refresh the page.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if Subtrace doesn't detect my app?">
    Verify that:
    - Your app is running with `subtrace run -- my-app`
    - The `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` env var is set (check with `echo $SUBTRACE_TOKEN`)
    - Your app is running on a Linux machine. If you're using macOS, see [here](/macos)

    If these don't solve your issue, reach out to support@subtrace.dev.
    We're happy to help!

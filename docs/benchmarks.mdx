Subtrace is incredibly lightweight and adds negligible overhead to the latency
of your backend requests. Even under extreme load, it adds less than 1
millisecond in latency; under typical loads, you can expect less than 0.1ms
in added latency. For reference, the latency between machines within the *same*
datacenter is usually [4-10 milliseconds](https://www.cloudping.co/grid).

We periodically and publish measure the following latency and throughput impact
of Subtrace in the next two graphs. These benchmarks were performed on a AWS
`m5a.4xlarge` machine with 16 vCPUs and 64 GiB memory. Both the client and
server were on the same machine in order to eliminate network noise. In each
benchmark, 16 parallel clients continuously sent requests to a server running
running under Subtrace for 10 seconds.

While these benchmarks don't represent all types of workloads, they should give
you a sense of what to expect from integrating Subtrace. We encourage everyone
to measure the impact of Subtrace on their own app. If these numbers aren't
aligned with your observations, [let us know](mailto:support@subtrace.dev) and
we'll investigate. We care about performance deeply.

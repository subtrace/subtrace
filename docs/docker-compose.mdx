If you're using Docker Compose to run your app, you can use Subtrace to monitor
all of your backend requests. Here's how you can get started:

<Steps>
<Step>
Make the following change to your `Dockerfile` to install and use Subtrace
in your app's Docker image:

```diff
- CMD ["node", "./app.js"]
+ RUN curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh
+ CMD ["subtrace", "run", "--", "node", "./app.js"]
```

</Step>

<Step>
Add the following lines to your service's definition in your `compose.yaml`
file:

```yaml
cap_add:
  - SYS_PTRACE
```

</Step>

<Step>
Start your app as you normally would:

  <Expandable title="example output">
    <img className="rounded-xl" src="/images/docker-compose-link.png" />
  </Expandable>
</Step>

<Step>
That's it! Open the `subt.link` URL in your browser to see your app's requests
show up in real time:

<img className="rounded-xl" src="/images/subt-link-example.png" />

<Info>
  It's possible that the `subt.link` URL is printed from within a container.

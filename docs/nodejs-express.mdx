You can connect your NodeJS backend to Chrome DevTools using Subtrace so that
you can can inspect the status, headers, payload, and latency of all requests.
It takes just one command to integrate Subtrace.

For this guide, we'll use the following NodeJS + Express app as an example:

```js
// app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`listening on port ${port}`)
});
```

Download the latest version of Subtrace using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh
```

And get a `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` from the Subtrace [dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard)
for free to set it as an environment variable.

```bash
# get a tracer token for free at https://subtrace.dev/dashboard
export SUBTRACE_TOKEN=
```

Start your server using Subtrace with the following command:

```
subtrace run -- node app.js
```

Send some requests to `localhost:3000` to see them automatically appear in
Chrome DevTools in the Subtrace dashboard!

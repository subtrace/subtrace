If you deploy your application on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), Subtrace
is the easiest way to monitor the network activity in your cluster in realtime.

### Updating your ECS task to support Subtrace

1. Open **ECS** → **Task definitions**, go to your task and click **Create new revision with JSON**.

2. In the JSON editor, add the `SYS_PTRACE` Linux capability to your container `linuxParameters` field:

     ```json
     "linuxParameters": {
       "capabilities": {
         "add": ["SYS_PTRACE"]
       }
     },
     ```

   The `SYS_PTRACE` capability is required because it's what allows Subtrace
   to automatically monitor network activity without any code changes or root
   privileges. The ECS UI does not expose this field, hence the JSON-based
   update to the task definition.

   Set the API token that you created in the [Subtrace dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard)
   as an environment variable:

     ```json
     "environment": [
       {
         "name": "SUBTRACE_ANCIENT_KERNEL",
         "value": "1"
       },
       {
         "name": "SUBTRACE_TOKEN",
         "value": "subt_****************"
       }
     ]
     ```
 
   As an example, here's what the task JSON should look like:

3. Click **Create** to create a new task revision.

<Tip>
Subtrace recommends using a Linux kernel of 5.14 or newer, which requires the
[EC2 launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters_ec2.html)
for your tasks. The
[Fargate launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html),
which is the default, is still on kernel 5.10 as of May 2025.

Set the `SUBTRACE_ANCIENT_KERNEL=1` environment variable in your task
definition to use Subtrace if your cluster is based on the Fargate launch type
by modifying your task with the web interface or by editing the task JSON:

     ```json
     "environment": [
       {
         "name": "SUBTRACE_ANCIENT_KERNEL",
         "value": "1"
       }
     ]
     ```

### Deploying a new revision of your service

4. Back in **Clusters** → **Services** → `my-app-service`, click on **Update service**.

5. In the dropdown, select the revision you just created (or leave blank for “latest”).
   ![choose new revision](/images/ecs/8-service-revision.png)

6. Click **Update** at the bottom. ECS will spin up a new task with the new definition; when it’s healthy, the old one will be stopped.

7. Go to the Subtrace UI and see a realtime stream of all network activity in your service.

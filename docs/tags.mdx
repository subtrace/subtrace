You can configure Subtrace to tag requests to categorize and search faster when
you're dealing with large request volumes. For instance, if you have a
microservice architecture, it's useful to tag each request by the service name
so that you can filter requests by service later. Here's an example config:

```yaml
tags:
  service_name: payments-api
  deploy_env: prod
  has_gpu: false
```

Use the `--config` command line flag to pass the config file to Subtrace:

```bash
subtrace run --config=/path/to/subtrace.yaml -- node app.js
```

## Default Tags

Subtrace automatically populates requests with the following set of default set
of tags based on the information it can gather about the environment:

- `hostname`

The following default tags may be relevant if you're on Google Cloud:

- `gcp_project`
- `gke_cluster_location`
- `gke_cluster_name`
- `gke_node_name`

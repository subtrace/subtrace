Once you've installed Subtrace and you've signed in to the [dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard),
you can view all the requests flowing through your app in real time! You can also inspect the headers,
payload, and request/response bodies:

<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
  <source src="videos/live_requests.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<Info>
  If your requests have timing information via the
  [Server-Timing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Server-Timing)
  header, it will show up in the "Timing" tab as seen above.
</Info>

## Filtering requests

The filter bar in the dashboard allows you to restrict what kind of requests
show up on the Subtrace dashboard. For example, maybe you want to see only
requests that look like `api/HealthCheck`. You could use the filter
`request.url.endsWith("api/HealthCheck")` to achieve this.

Here's the filter in action:

<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
  <source src="videos/filter_use.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<Info>
  The syntax used in the filter bar is the same as in Subtrace's config file.
  You can find more details about the syntax [here](rules#syntax).

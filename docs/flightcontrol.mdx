If you deploy your app using Flightcontrol, you can use Subtrace to monitor all its
requests. Here's how you can get started:

1. Add these lines to your `flightcontrol.json` file under the `target` section:

```json {3-4}
"target": {
    "type": "fargate",
    "linuxCapabilities": {
        "add": ["SYS_PTRACE"]
    }
}
```

2. Add the `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` environment variable to Flightcontrol:

<img className="rounded-xl" src="/images/flightcontrol/env-var.png" />

<Tip>
  If you donâ€™t have a Subtrace token yet, go to the Tokens page on the [dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard) and
  create a tracer token.
</Tip>

3. Deploy your app as you normally do on Flightcontrol.

<br />

That's it! You can now visit your app and make some requests to see them automatically appear in the Subtrace
dashboard.

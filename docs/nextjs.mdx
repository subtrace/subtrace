For this guide, we'll use a minimal Next.js app as an example, but any Next.js app should work fine.
You can find the complete source code used in this demo [here](https://github.com/subtrace/nextjs-demo).

To get started, download the latest version of Subtrace using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Then get a `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` from the Subtrace [dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard)
for free and set it as an environment variable.

```bash
# get a tracer token for free at https://subtrace.dev/dashboard
export SUBTRACE_TOKEN=
```

Build and start your server using Subtrace:

```bash
npm install
subtrace run -- npm run dev
```

That's it! You can now visit [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to see them automatically appear in the Subtrace [dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard) in realtime.

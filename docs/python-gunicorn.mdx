You can connect your Gunicorn backend to Chrome DevTools using Subtrace with
just one command. With Subtrace, you can inspect the status, headers, payload,
and latency of all API requests so you can debug way faster.

For this guide, we'll use the following Gunicorn app as an example:

```python
# myapp.py
def app(environ, start_response):
    data = b"Hello, World!\n"
    start_response("200 OK", [
        ("Content-Type", "text/plain"),
        ("Content-Length", str(len(data)))
    ])
    return iter([data])
```

To start, download the latest version of Subtrace:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Get a `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` from the Subtrace [dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard)
for free to set it as an environment variable.

```bash
# get a tracer token for free at https://subtrace.dev/dashboard
export SUBTRACE_TOKEN=
```

To start your server on port 8000, run the following command:

```bash
subtrace run -- gunicorn -w 4 myapp:app
```

Send a request to `localhost:8000` to see it in the Subtrace dashboard!

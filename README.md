Subtrace is Chrome DevTools for your backend. It tracks the API requests coming
in and going out of your servers so that you can solve problems in production
quickly. Later, when you're solving a problem in production, you can filter for
the requests you care about using simple SQL queries and dig into the details
(e.g. headers, payload, latency). With Subtrace, you'll never have to `console.log()`
a HTTP request again.

#### Features

* Works out-of-the-box
* Supports all languages (Python, Node, Go, and everything else)
* No instrumentation code changes required
* Less than 100µs performance overhead
* Built on Clickhouse
* Open source

#### Code Contributions

While Subtrace is [open source](https://github.com/subtrace/subtrace/blob/master/LICENSE),
we're not currently accepting pull requests. This is because we're a startup
with a very small team and we don't have the resources or documentation
necessary to maintain a good open source community in a way that still allows
us to move quickly. This will probably change in the future.

With that said, we welcome all feature requests and bug reports, so feel free
to [open an issue](https://github.com/subtrace/subtrace/issues/new/choose).

Subtrace is Wireshark for your Docker containers. It lets developers see all
incoming and outgoing requests in their backend server so that they can resolve
production issues faster.

#### Features

* Works out-of-the-box
* No code changes needed
* Supports all languages (Python + Node + Go + everything else)
* See full payload, headers, status code, and latency
* Less than 100µs performance overhead
* Built on Clickhouse
* Open source

#### Code Contributions

While Subtrace is [open source](https://github.com/subtrace/subtrace/blob/master/LICENSE),
we're not currently accepting pull requests. This is because we're a startup
with a very small team and we don't have the resources or documentation
necessary to maintain a good open source community in a way that still allows
us to move quickly. This will probably change in the future.

With that said, we welcome all feature requests and bug reports, so feel free
to [open an issue](https://github.com/subtrace/subtrace/issues/new/choose).
